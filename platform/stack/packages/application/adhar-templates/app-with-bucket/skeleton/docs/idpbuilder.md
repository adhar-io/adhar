# IDP Builder

Internal development platform binary launcher.

> **WORK IN PROGRESS**: This tool is in a pre-release stage and is under active development.

## About

Spin up a complete internal developer platform using industry standard technologies like Kubernetes, Argo, and backstage with only Docker required as a dependency.

This can be useful in several ways:
* Create a single binary which can demonstrate an IDP reference implementation.
* Use within CI to perform integration testing.
* Use as a local development environment for platform engineers.
