## Getting started :sparkles:

### Terraform :zap:

To create new kubernetes cluster and install Adhar platform, you can use provided terraform script based on your cloud provider. Before starting the process make sure you have a cloud account ready:

> **_NOTE:_** In this example showing `digitalocean` setup, you can follow same steps for other clouds as well.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adhar-io/adhar.git
cd platform/installer/digitalocean

# Update your Cloud API Key
export DO_TOKEN="<YOUR-DO-TOKEN>"

# Run terraform
terraform init
do_token="<YOUR-DO-TOKEN>" terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### Helm :boat:

To install Adhar platform, make sure to have a kubernetes cluster running with at least:

- Version `1.26`, `1.27` or `1.28`
- A node pool with at least **16 vCPU** and **32GB+ RAM** (more resources might be required based on the additional capabilities)
- Calico CNI installed (or any other CNI that supports K8s network policies)
- A default storage class configured
- When using the `custom` provider, make sure the K8s LoadBalancer Service created by `Adhar` can obtain an external IP (using a cloud load balancer or MetalLB)

> **_NOTE:_** Install Adhar with DNS to unlock it's full potential. Check [adhar.io](https://adhar.io) for more info.

Add the Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add adhar https://chart.adhar.io
helm repo update
```

and then install the Helm chart:

```bash
helm install adhar adhar/adhar \
--set cluster.name=adhar-dev \
--set cluster.provider=digitalocean # use 'azure', 'aws', 'google', 'digitalocean', 'civo', or 'custom' for any other cloud or onprem K8s
```

## Platform Architecture :crystal_ball:

<p align="center"><img src="docs/imgs/adhar-platform.svg" width="100%" alt="Adhar platform"></p>

## Platform Components

### Adhar Console (Self Service Portal)

Adhar Console stands as the centerpiece of our platform, offering a seamless user experience tailored for both developers and platform administrators. It serves as a one-stop solution for a multitude of tasks. Developers can leverage the Adhar Console to build images, deploy applications, expose services, configure CNAMEs, manage network policies, and handle secrets.

On the other hand, platform administrators can use it to enable and configure platform capabilities, as well as onboard development teams. The Adhar Console goes beyond just a web-based self-service portal, providing direct and context-aware access to platform capabilities like code repositories, registries, logs, metrics, traces, and dashboards.

Moreover, it includes a Cloud Shell feature, allowing both developers and admins to run CLI commands. In essence, the Adhar Console is a comprehensive tool designed to streamline and simplify the management of your platform.

![Adhar Console](docs/imgs/adhar-console-light.png#gh-light-mode-only)

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

The Adhar Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a powerful tool for developers and administrators to interact with the Adhar platform, enabling them to manage resources, execute tasks, and automate workflows directly from the command line.

### Controlplane (api-server)

In the Adhar platform, the api-server plays a crucial role in enabling seamless integration. Every alteration made via the Console is first verified by the api-server within the control plane. Once validated, these changes are stored in the state store. This action initiates an automatic process where the platform aligns the actual state with the desired state, thereby ensuring smooth integration and consistency across the platform.

### Adhar Assist (AI)

Adhar Assist is an innovative feature of the Adhar platform that integrates AI assistance into your workflow. It leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to provide intelligent recommendations, automate routine tasks, and enhance decision-making processes. Whether you're configuring your platform, troubleshooting issues, or optimizing performance, Adhar Assist is there to guide you. It learns from your platform's data and usage patterns, continually improving its assistance over time. With Adhar Assist, you get a smart companion that helps you make the most of the Adhar platform. As a developer, you will enjoy the assistance provided by `Adhar Assist` during development.

### Git Based Infrastructure

Upon installation of Adhar, the desired state of the platform is captured and preserved in the Git repository, specifically within the `adhar/values` repository in the Gitea. This Git-based state store plays a pivotal role in infrastructure management, serving as a reliable and version-controlled source of truth. Any modifications made through the Console are promptly mirrored in this repository. This approach not only ensures consistency and traceability but also facilitates collaboration and rollback capabilities, underscoring the importance of a Git-based state store in modern infrastructure.

### Golden Templates Catalog

The `adhar/helm-charts` Git repository houses a collection of built-in Helm charts, which serve as the backbone for creating workloads within the Console. These charts are designed as golden templates, adhering to trending technology standards, ensuring optimal performance and compatibility. In addition to the built-in charts, the platform also offers the flexibility to add custom charts. This allows users to tailor their workloads to specific needs while maintaining the benefits of standardization. Thus, the `adhar/helm-charts` repository is not just a resource, but a gateway to efficient and standardized workload management on the Adhar platform.

### Automation & Self Service

Automation and self-service capabilities are crucial aspects of modern platforms like Adhar. Automation helps in maintaining consistency, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency by automating repetitive tasks. For instance, it can be used to synchronize the desired state with the actual state of applications, ensuring they are always in sync and reducing the need for manual intervention. On the other hand, self-service capabilities empower users by giving them direct control over their services. This not only improves user satisfaction by providing immediate access to services but also reduces the load on support teams. In the context of Adhar, a platform that serves over a billion users, these features are not just beneficial, they are essential for scalability and user satisfaction.

## Platform Capabilities
