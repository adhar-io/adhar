## Platform Architecture :crystal_ball:

<p align="center"><img src="docs/imgs/adhar-platform.svg" width="100%" alt="Adhar platform"></p>

### Self-service Portal and CLI

The self-service portal (Adhar Console) offers seamless user experience for developers and platform administrators. Platform administrators can use Otomi Console to enable and configure platform capabilities and onboard development teams. Developers can use Otomi Console to build images, deploy applications, expose services, configure CNAMEs, configure network policies and manage secrets. Otomi Console also provided direct and context aware access to platform capabilities like code repositories, registries, logs, metrics, traces, dashboards, etc. Next to the web based self-service, both developers and admins can start a Cloud Shell and run cli commands.

### Desired state store

When Adhar is installed, the desired state of the platform is stored in the Desired State Store (the `adhar/helm-chart-values` repo in the local Git repository). Changes made through the Console will be reflected in the repo.

### Golden templates catalog

The `adhar/helm-charts` Git repo includes a set of build-in Helm charts that are used to create workloads in the Console. You can also add your own charts and offer them to the users of the platform.

### Control plane

All changes made through the Console are validated by the control plane (`api-server`) and then committed in the state store. This will automatically trigger the platform to synchronize the desired state to the actual state of the platform.

### Automation

The automation is used to synchronize desired state with the state of applications like Keycloak, Harbor and Gitea.
